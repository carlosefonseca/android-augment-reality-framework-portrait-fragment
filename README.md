android-augment-reality-framework-portrait-fragment
===================================================

A fork of https://code.google.com/p/android-augment-reality-framework made to work on a fragment and on portrait.

â€” Please note that I've been messing with this for my own needs. If you only want the fragments and portrait stuff, please use the `fragments-portrait` branch. Thank you.
